# Transgiving
A list of trans creators whose work you can support over the US Thanksgiving weekend and beyond! We're especially hoping to highlight trans POC, but anyone can participate - the more the merrier!

## How it works
You can add yourself to the list in one of two ways.

Edit this file, if you know how, and add yourself to the bottom of the list; then submit a pull request (one of us will review it and add you ASAP).

Or, contact transgiving2017@gmail.com with the following information:

* Your name
* Your website (if applicable; this can just be Twitter or Mastodon if you want)
* What you do and/or sell
* Where people can support you (Patreon, Redbubble, Paypal.me, etc. are fine. Include as many as you want.)
